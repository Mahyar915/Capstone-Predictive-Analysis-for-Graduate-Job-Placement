This project analyzes graduates from the University of Findlay to identify factors contributing to securing a job with an annual salary of $70,000 or more. 
The study begins with data preprocessing to prepare the data set for analysis. Following this, three machine learning modelsâ€”Binary Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest
are employed and compared to determine which model performs best.
